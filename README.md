# Covid19DataAnalysis


1) Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.
2) Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.
3) Merging two datasets and finding correlations among our data.
4) Visualizing our analysis results using Seaborn.

This project is part of my solution for the Coursera Project.
